# Debug Log Examples and Analysis

## Current Behavior - Successful Detection, Failed Injection

### Example 1: Letter 's' Input
```
[HOOK] WM_KEYDOWN - VK:E7 (Packet) - ScanCode:73 - Flags:00
[RDP] Detected VK_PACKET - RDP software keyboard event
[PACKET] Unicode character: 's' (0x0073) - DOWN
[PACKET] VkKeyScan result: VK=53, ShiftState=00
[INJECT] Active window: 'Warp' (Class: WarpTerminal)
[INJECT] VK:53 -> ScanCode:1F (from mapping table)
[INJECT] Attempting multiple injection methods for scancode 1F (DOWN)
[INJECT] Method 1 (scancode only): 0 (Error: 87)
[INJECT] Method 2 (VK+scancode): 0 (Error: 87)
[INJECT] Method 3 (VK only): 0 (Error: 87)
[INJECT] Method 4 (keybd_event): Trying VK=53 Scan=1F
[INJECT] Method 4 (keybd_event scancode): Executed successfully
[HOOK] WM_KEYUP - VK:E7 (Packet) - ScanCode:73 - Flags:80
[RDP] Detected VK_PACKET - RDP software keyboard event
[PACKET] Unicode character: 's' (0x0073) - UP
[PACKET] VkKeyScan result: VK=53, ShiftState=00
[INJECT] Active window: 'Warp' (Class: WarpTerminal)
[INJECT] VK:53 -> ScanCode:1F (from mapping table)
[INJECT] Attempting multiple injection methods for scancode 1F (UP)
[INJECT] Method 1 (scancode only): 0 (Error: 87)
[INJECT] Method 2 (VK+scancode): 0 (Error: 87)
[INJECT] Method 3 (VK only): 0 (Error: 87)
[INJECT] Method 4 (keybd_event): Trying VK=53 Scan=1F
[INJECT] Method 4 (keybd_event scancode): Executed successfully
```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ VK_PACKET detection: PERFECT
- ✅ Unicode extraction: 's' (0x0073) correctly extracted
- ✅ VK conversion: VK=53 (correct for 'S' key)
- ✅ Scancode mapping: 1F (correct scancode for 'S')
- ❌ All SendInput methods fail with Error 87
- ❌ keybd_event reports success but no effect in target app

### Example 2: Space Key Input
```
[HOOK] WM_KEYDOWN - VK:E7 (Packet) - ScanCode:20 - Flags:00
[RDP] Detected VK_PACKET - RDP software keyboard event
[PACKET] Unicode character: ' ' (0x0020) - DOWN
[PACKET] VkKeyScan result: VK=20, ShiftState=00
[INJECT] VK:20 -> ScanCode:39 (from mapping table)
[INJECT] Method 4 (keybd_event scancode): Executed successfully
```

**Analysis:**
- Space character (0x0020) correctly detected
- VK=20 (VK_SPACE) correctly converted
- Scancode=39 (correct for spacebar)
- Same failure pattern as letters

### Example 3: Chinese Characters
```
[HOOK] WM_KEYDOWN - VK:E7 (Packet) - ScanCode:60A8 - Flags:00
[RDP] Detected VK_PACKET - RDP software keyboard event
[PACKET] Unicode character: '您' (0x60A8) - DOWN
[PACKET] Cannot convert Unicode char '您' to virtual key

[HOOK] WM_KEYDOWN - VK:E7 (Packet) - ScanCode:597D - Flags:00
[RDP] Detected VK_PACKET - RDP software keyboard event
[PACKET] Unicode character: '好' (0x597D) - DOWN
[PACKET] Cannot convert Unicode char '好' to virtual key
```

**Analysis:**
- Chinese characters correctly detected in VK_PACKET
- VkKeyScan() correctly returns -1 (cannot convert)
- This is expected behavior - no injection attempted

### Example 4: Physical Enter Key (Success Case)
```
[HOOK] WM_KEYDOWN - VK:0D (Return) - ScanCode:1C - Flags:00
[SKIP] Physical keyboard event - ScanCode:1C, Flags:00
[HOOK] WM_KEYUP - VK:0D (Return) - ScanCode:1C - Flags:80
[RDP?] Possible RDP event - VK:0D ScanCode:1C Flags:80
[RDP] Processing RDP event - VK:0D (Return) - Converting to scancode
[INJECT] VK:0D -> ScanCode:1C (from mapping table)
[INJECT] Method 4 (keybd_event scancode): Executed successfully
```

**Analysis:**
- Physical Enter key detected with Flags:80 on KEYUP
- Misclassified as RDP event due to flags
- BUT: This actually works in VS Code Claude extension!
- Proves target applications CAN receive injected input

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Error 87 (ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER) Consistent Pattern
Every SendInput call fails with Error 87:
- Method 1 (scancode only): Error 87
- Method 2 (VK+scancode): Error 87  
- Method 3 (VK only): Error 87

**Possible Causes:**
1. RDP session security restrictions
2. INPUT structure parameter validation failure
3. Desktop/Session context mismatch
4. Integrity level restrictions

### keybd_event "Success" But No Effect
- All keybd_event calls report "Executed successfully"
- No exceptions thrown
- But no keystrokes reach target application
- Suggests injection happening in wrong context

## Key Insights from Logs

### 1. Detection Pipeline is Perfect
The entire front-end detection and parsing pipeline works flawlessly:
- Global hook captures all RDP events
- VK_PACKET events correctly identified
- Unicode characters properly extracted
- VK/Scancode conversion accurate

### 2. Physical Enter Key Success Proves Viability
- Physical Enter key DOES trigger in VS Code Claude extension
- Proves target applications can receive low-level input
- Indicates issue is with injection method, not target apps

### 3. RDP Security Model is the Blocker
- Error 87 pattern indicates Windows parameter validation
- RDP imposes stricter security on input injection
- Need alternative injection approach for RDP environment

## Recommended Debug Steps

### 1. Add Session Context Logging
```c#
// Log current session details
uint processId = GetCurrentProcessId();
ProcessIdToSessionId(processId, out uint sessionId);
Console.WriteLine($"[DEBUG] Current session ID: {sessionId}");

// Log target window session
GetWindowThreadProcessId(foregroundWindow, out uint targetPid);
ProcessIdToSessionId(targetPid, out uint targetSession);
Console.WriteLine($"[DEBUG] Target window session ID: {targetSession}");
```

### 2. Try PostMessage Direct Injection
```c#
// Send messages directly to target window
PostMessage(foregroundWindow, WM_KEYDOWN, (IntPtr)vkCode, IntPtr.Zero);
Thread.Sleep(10);
PostMessage(foregroundWindow, WM_KEYUP, (IntPtr)vkCode, IntPtr.Zero);
```

### 3. Test Different Timing
```c#
// Add delays between detection and injection
Thread.Sleep(50);  // 50ms delay
// Then inject
```

### 4. Check Desktop Context
```c#
// Compare desktop handles
IntPtr currentDesktop = GetThreadDesktop(GetCurrentThreadId());
// Get target thread desktop and compare
```

## Success Criteria for Next Iteration

### Must Achieve
- ✅ SendInput returns 1 (success) instead of 0 (failed)
- ✅ Injected keystrokes actually appear in Warp Terminal
- ✅ No Error 87 on any injection method

### Should Achieve  
- ✅ Maintain current perfect detection pipeline
- ✅ Handle both keydown and keyup events
- ✅ Support all ASCII characters (A-Z, 0-9, space, punctuation)

### Could Achieve
- ✅ Support for Chinese/Unicode characters via alternative methods
- ✅ Modifier key support (Shift, Ctrl, Alt combinations)
- ✅ Performance optimization and reduced logging in production

## Log Monitoring Commands

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
# Watch for injection failures
grep -i "Error: 87" translator_output.log

# Monitor successful detections
grep -i "PACKET.*character" translator_output.log

# Check target window focus
grep -i "Active window" translator_output.log
```

### Pattern Analysis
```bash
# Count successful vs failed injections
grep -c "Method.*success" translator_output.log
grep -c "Error: 87" translator_output.log

# Character coverage analysis
grep "Unicode character" translator_output.log | sort | uniq -c
```
